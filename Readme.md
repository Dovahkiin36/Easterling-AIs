# Easterling AIs 

This mod contains **14** new AIs, including 10 completely reworked Lords.

### The AIs
These well-known friends have new spells and behaviors, just like you know them from **Stronghold 1**:
- Rat
- Snake
- Pig
- Wolf

As support against the evil four, Sir Longarm gets reinforcements from **Stronghold 1**:
- King
- Lord Woolsack
- Abbot
- Lord Manikin
- Advisor

**New** to this, from the ranks of the Assassins:
- Scorpion: *Al Mualim from Assassins Creed 1*

Adjusted AI behavior, **without** new spells/characters
- Arsonist: *Watch out for fire!
- Camel: *Does not need food*
- Sultan: *Does not want peasants in his palace*
- Falcon: *Does not build a castle, but a thriving trading town*

### Easterling's AI Mod on ModDB
This is a different version. The AIs for UCP3 have been recycled. This is **not** 1:1 the old mod that was published on ModDB. This was made with the UCP2 and focused on the challenge in the crusade trail.
